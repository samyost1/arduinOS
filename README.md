# ArduinOS - Arduino Operating System

ArduinOS is a custom operating system built for the Arduino Uno, designed to overcome the limitations of the Arduino platform, such as single-program execution and lack of a file system. This operating system enables multitasking capabilities, allowing the Arduino to run multiple programs concurrently, and provides a file system to store and retrieve files even in the event of power loss.


## Features

- **Command Line Interface**: ArduinOS supports command input via the serial terminal, allowing users to interact with the operating system.
- **Execution of Bytecode Programs**: The operating system can execute programs written in the prescribed bytecode format, stored as files in the file system. The bytecode programs are generated by using the included convert program.
- **Memory Management**: ArduinOS manages a memory space, capable of storing and manipulating the values of 25 variables of various types, including CHAR (1 byte), INT (2 bytes), FLOAT (4 bytes), and STRING (zero-terminated, variable-length).
- **File System**: The operating system maintains a file system within the available EEPROM memory, capable of storing, retrieving, and deleting up to 10 files. File names can have a maximum length of 12 characters, including the terminating zero.
- **Storage Capacity**: ArduinOS provides a feature to display the remaining available storage space within the file system.
- **Process Management**: The operating system can handle up to 10 different processes, supporting operations such as starting, pausing, resuming, and terminating processes.
- **Variable Scope**: ArduinOS tracks the association of variables with specific processes, freeing up memory occupied by variables when a process terminates.
- **Stack Management**: ArduinOS maintains a stack of 32 bytes for each process.


## Command Line Interface

The following commands are available in the command line interface:

| Command       | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `STORE file size`    | Stores a file with the specified name in the file system. |
| `RETRIEVE file` | Retrieves a file from the file system.                       |
| `ERASE file`   | Erases a file from the file system.                           |
| `FILES`        | Prints a list of files in the file system.                    |
| `FREESPACE`    | Prints the available storage space in the file system.        |
| `RUN file`     | Starts executing a program.                                  |
| `LIST`         | Prints a list of active processes.                           |
| `SUSPEND id`   | Pauses a process with the specified ID.                      |
| `RESUME id`    | Resumes a paused process with the specified ID.              |
| `KILL id`      | Terminates a process with the specified ID.                  |


## Converting Bytecode

ArduinOS uses a converter tool to convert bytecode files to a format compatible with the Arduino sketch. To convert a bytecode file, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the `converter` directory in the ArduinOS repository.
3. Run the following command:
`convert <bytecode_file> <output_file> [COMx]`
4. Start ArduinOS on your Arduino board.
5. In the ArduinOS command line interface, run the `FILES` command to see the available files in the file system.
6. Run the `RUN <file_name>` command to execute the converted bytecode file.
